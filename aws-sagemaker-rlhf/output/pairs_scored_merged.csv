Set realistic goals and do not compare yourself to others. Instead, choose to focus on your positive qualities and what you have accomplished thus far. When you see your accomplishments in this light, it is easier to maintain a healthy attitude and a healthy self-image. Your physical appearance does not determine your self-worth.

It can be easy to feel like you are always “on” and give as much as you give. You are not only impacting your own health and well-being by “giving” so much, but also creating spaces in your schedule to take care of yourself. You need time to rest, eat well, and participate in the activities you love. You are not doing anyone a favor by taking care of yourself. You are important, and so is the care you provide. Here are a few resources and tips to help you take care of yourself:1. Make a list of self-care activities that you could participate in, such as taking a walk, reading, meditating, cooking, exercising, or calling a friend.2.

320,"A coworker is feeling stressed about an upcoming deadline. Provide a response that offers empathy, suggests time management techniques, and reminds them of their capabilities.","I understand how feeling stressed about an upcoming deadline can amplify the stress response. When we feel stressed, our bodies react by increasing the release of cortisol. This can leave us feeling more on edge, unable to focus, and our skin begins to look drier. What’s interesting is that our memory of the stressful event is actually impacted by the increase in cortisol. To help minimize the impact of the release of cortisol, I’d like to suggest some time management techniques. First, I recommend taking a break from whatever is making you feel stressed. Turn off your notifications, sit in a quiet space, and focus on other activities that make you feel calm, like taking a walk or meditating. Next, I recommend writing out a list of things that make you feel calm, and focusing on those activities during times when you feel stressed. When we feel stressed, we often default to thinking about what we need to do to calm down, but we cannot control the way our mind works. By focusing on things that calm us, we are calming our response to stress. Last, I want you to remember your capabilities in this situation. You are an incredibly capable person.

In addition, I encourage you to think about ways that you could disconnect during long stretches of work. Getting away from your desk helps to recharge your mental resources.

For example, it’s important for your physical and mental health to make sure you’re getting enough sleep and eating well. Caregiving can be physically and emotionally demanding, and making sure you’re taking care of your own needs will make it easier for you to provide the care you need for your loved one.

Starting a new project is no easy feat, and even though you're a talented and capable developer, it can be easy to feel like you don't know much and are losing clarity on where to start. My advice is to stop looking at this as a strictly technical challenge and instead look at it as a learning opportunity. It may seem like you don't know anything, but you actually have a lot of knowledge to bring to the table. The only problem is that you don't have the experience yet to tie all those pieces of knowledge together in an organized, efficient way. So my advice is to take a step back and learn more about the domain you're working in. Here are some ways you could do that:- Subscribe to popular newsletters and blogs from your industry. If you don't have access to these yet, ask a friend at your company to introduce you or make an introduction.

One thing that you mentioned that you’d like to work on is creating a spending plan to help you feel more in control of your finances. I’d be happy to help provide some strategies on this! Start by reviewing your budget to identify any unnecessary spending and consider if you could cut any non-essential items to create a more accurate monthly figure. I recommend not making any big changes right away - instead, take some time to consider your financial goals and write down your thoughts in a journal to create a clear vision for your ideal financial situation. Once you have a clear idea, you can start working towards your goals by reallocating your money towards your financial goals. You can do this by setting a monthly amount that you’d like to save and transfer it from your checking account to your goal account. At the end of each month, evaluate your spending and see if you’re on track to hit your monthly goal - if not, take what you’ve saved and adjust your spending or reallocate to a different goal if needed.

While we can control what we allow into our minds, we cannot control how others perceive us, and even when we perform well in a situation that requires us to be on stage or in front of a group. In that way, our careers as coaches are very similar to acting; there are going to be performances we are not going to enjoy or are even anxious about, but we have to do our best and move on.

Self-confidence doesn’t mean you forget about your accomplishments, but it does mean you recognize that you’re not perfect. It’s also important to remember that not every failure requires the same amount of confidence. You will encounter obstacles in life, and some will be easier to overcome than others. Your confidence won’t change based on how you view an obstacle; instead, your ability to overcome it will change. Encourage your friend by sharing your experience of overcoming difficult obstacles.

In order to support them in this process, it’s important to share your own conflict resolution strategies with them. While there are no “right” ways to resolve conflict, here are some common strategies to consider:Ask for clarity – “I’m curious what you mean when you say...” This gives them the opportunity to express their thoughts more clearly and avoids any miscommunication about what was meant.Acknowledge their feelings – Often feelings of anger or sadness can lead to actions that are not logical or make sense. Affirming their feelings helps them to process them, and come to a resolution on their own.Ask for their opinion – You can use this to find a middle ground between their original idea and what you think might work best. Taking turns sharing your ideas and listening to each other’s opinions helps build trust and respect.Set a time limit – If neither party is able to come to a resolution, it’s possible to set a time limit on how long they will try to resolve it on their own before seeking help from an outside party.If they still seem stuck, it may be helpful to help them find someone else who can",3,1.46978497505188

Even if it were possible to walk on water tomorrow, you'd assume that I wouldn't because I don't yet have evidence that I can. The same concept applies to fear. It's not real. It doesn't exist.

99,Your partner shares their fear of public speaking. Offer a response that offers comfort and suggests techniques to manage anxiety.,"Oftentimes, public speaking fears are based on limited experience or misunderstandings about what is required in the particular situation.

But the anticipated fear or anxiety is usually disproportionate to the actual requirement. You also probably won’t vomit. So speak up and share your thoughts!At a more fundamental level, you likely don’t want to speak in public because it means that you have something to say that you feel is important enough that other people should hear it. You’ve likely been practicing and preparing and honing your skills to share that message. And now that your partner has heard you speak, you feel more confident in your ability to share it with others. But public speaking is not a binary event: it happens only when the audience is there and prepared to hear you. Most people who share a new idea, or something they deeply care about, will get nervous too.

For example, we have studied examples of successful small towns that have invested in entrepreneurial activity, such as bike shops, donut shops, and co-working spaces.3.

Remember that it's natural to feel this way, and there are others who share your experience and can relate to what you're going through.If you want to work on building self-esteem, I have some recommendations for how you can get started.1. Remember that your self-esteem is a work in progress. Even though we can't control how other people treat us, we can decide how we respond to the treatment we receive. Remember that low self-esteem is not a permanent condition, and focus on what you can control.2. Set goals for yourself that are challenging but attainable. Don't focus on big, unrealistic goals. Instead, focus on small, short-term goals. Break down each goal into smaller steps that you can focus on one step at a time.3. Don't compare yourself to other people. This is another unrealistic way to measure your progress. Each of us has a unique personality, and we all have different strengths",3,2.22869920730591

My suggestion would be to carve out time every day to dedicate entirely to work related activities. For example, set aside an hour each day for focused collaborating on a key deliverable, or meet with your team for a roundtable discussion. If you find yourself struggling to transition out of work at the end of the day, consider building in a ""homework"" component to your dedicated work time. You could dedicate another 30-90 minutes at the end of the workday to wrap up any outstanding work tasks or emails. In addition to carving out dedicated blocks of time, you might consider building in flexibility into your daily schedule. For example, try scheduling that time at night or on the weekends so that you can attend to the work-life balance regardless of the demands of your kids. Another strategy might be to consider more altruistic goals to focus on. For example, you could commit to increasing your direct reports' engagement with you. Rather than focusing on running through your checklist of ""to dos"", try committing to completing one higher-level goal per week. For example, I could commit to spending 15 minutes each day reviewing the project feedback my team provided for",2,1.46541595458984

It could seem overwhelming and unproductive to spend time engaged in local politics and community groups when they could be focused on building their lives and ensuring their family is well cared for. This response can be an effective one, but it means they will be missing out on important context that could help them play a more effective role moving forward.2) They could jump in head first.

I’ve felt that way before and know how it can feel like you’re being pulled in a thousand directions at once. I’m so glad you shared your feelings with me. Here’s some things I’ve found helpful when things felt uncertain or too much to handle. First, try to be present in the moment and pay attention to your breathing. Most of our worries and anxiety aren’t based in fact. Second, recognize that you’re not alone and this is normal. There are others who feel the same way you do. A third way I’ve found helpful is to try to identify what is really driving your worry and then step back to see if there is any truth behind it. For example, I find that sometimes my worries are rooted in my desire for things to remain static and not change. I like knowing what I know now and feeling like I’ve got control over things. That’s not how life is though. Things change and will continue to change. I’ve learned to let go of trying to control everything and put my energy into areas where I can have the biggest impact.

Write down a clear, concise list of the things you're trying to accomplish and the actions you've taken so far. Second, think about how you can break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. For example, if you're working on a large web app, you might break down the frontend and backend into smaller components. Then, you can tackle each component in turn.

You are worried that tears will disrupt the flow of the presentation and affect your child's performance. You want to encourage your child and remind them of their capabilities.You can help by keeping the following in mind:1. Anxiety and fear can often lead to tears. When you are anxious, it is natural to want to avoid things you are afraid of. Tears help us process our emotions. So, if your child starts to cry, you should acknowledge this and talk to them about why they are crying. You can ask them if they are afraid, and what they are afraid of. Then, you can offer support by letting them know you are here for them, and help them think through their fears and move forward in a more confident state.2. The presentation is about their capabilities, their voice is a unique voice and deserves to be heard. Children often compare themselves to others - if other students are giving a presentation, your child might feel as though they aren't able to speak up.

I also suggest she makes time each week for personal interests and self-care. In doing so, she can stay alert and productive without diluting her focus or risking burnout.If she needs help, I encourage her to set goals and timelines for herself to help stay focused and on track.

Second, take a deep breath and try to think of one or two things you can focus on to help alleviate the stress. Perhaps you could ask for help with the laundry or the kids, or ask if they could do a few things for you around the house. Third, it’s also ok to ask for some help and advice. What has worked for me in the past is to write down a list of things I need help with and then pick a task or two from the list.

Second, they should try and downsize their house so that they can maximize the benefits from the social security that they will receive. Third, they can spend more time enjoying the time they have left, rather than be worrying about the future, so they can spend their time focused on important things like family time, leisure time, and things that they will remember in the years to come.

Are you on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or another social media platform?

As you consider the opportunities in each bucket, think about what you are best at, what you enjoy, and what you can contribute to make things easier for those around you. Also, keep in mind the financial impacts of each choice you make. For example, by reducing work hours or eliminating a contract, you may be able to free up some time and allow for more personal time, or simply increase your take home pay. In many cases, making a few decisions in one bucket can lead to improvements in other buckets.

Provide a response that offers comfort and strategies to manage social anxiety.,"First, it is helpful to understand what is involved in social anxiety. Many believe that social anxiety is an irrational fear of what others think of us, but in fact it is much more complicated than that. True social anxiety is the result of interaction with a critical and even poisonous self-image. It is important that you take care of this part of you before proceeding with anything else. Remember, no one can truly know you except for you. If you let people truly get to know you, it will stop being about them and start being about you. This requires you to let go of many of your insecurities, including social insecurities, which are one of the worst types of all. If you cannot let go of these, I strongly recommend seeing a therapist to work through this, and/or discuss it with a sponsor, who is another person who has gone through many of the steps of recovery, but has a healthier mindset and does not carry around all the poisonous self-talk that you do.

Provide a response that offers empathy, support, and resources for building self-confidence.","I can really relate to what you're saying. I've noticed myself feeling shy and introverted throughout my life. At first, I thought it was just my personality, but then I realized it was probably because of my own low self-esteem. As an introvert, I prefer spending time alone, rather than socializing with others. I figured this was just how I was born, and there was nothing I could do to change it. This would usually make me feel terrible because I felt like I wasn't really living up to my full potential.Luckily, I've learned about self-esteem and confidence from my therapist. It sounds simple, but they really do go hand in hand. You can't build self-esteem if you don't even have confidence in yourself to start with. It's important to be kind to yourself. I used to criticize everything about myself, and that just made me feel worse. Instead of thinking of yourself as defective, try looking at yourself the way a kind friend would look at you. Try appreciating your good qualities, and helping yourself see the value in yourself.You mentioned you've been struggling with low self-esteem your entire life. That's so common for people with Asperger's, and",1,-1.82803666591644

Offer a response that offers comfort and suggests techniques to manage anxiety.,"My partner sharing their fear of public speaking sounds very difficult, but I understand where they are coming from. Speaking in public is a fear I have myself. I can empathize with their feelings and offer some techniques I have found to help manage anxiety. I recommend they try some of these techniques and see if they improve their level of comfort when speaking in public.1. Visualize speaking to a large crowd. They all seem to be listening intently and their faces indicate they are impressed. It feels natural, and they seem to be on their feet.2. Practice in a small group. They feel a little more at ease, but now they have an easier audience to look at.3. Audition for a part in a play. Again, they feel comfortable and they are off book.4. Record themselves practicing. Play it back and take some notes.5. Do a dry run in their head for a few minutes. Then take some notes.I would love to hear how they feel the next time they share their fear with me, and if it helps them to feel more comfortable preparing.",1,2.28854608535767

I hope you find a way to communicate your concerns to the other neighbor so that you can all live in harmony. Here are some possible strategies you could try: 1. Go through your local government's mediation services to help you both better understand your concerns and work towards a resolution. 2. If neither of the above approaches works for you, you could consider renting out your home to the other neighbor, or even selling your home, to remove yourself from the situation. 3. In the mean time, you could consider simple strategies like mowing your own lawn and reducing the outside noise level at night, so that you aren't disturbed. 4. Ultimately, you may need to consider more drastic measures like filing a lawsuit against your neighbor for interfering with your enjoyment of your property and engaging a real estate agent to list your home for sale.",1,-0.441543370485306

As a former athlete, I too experienced the pressure to look a certain way. I had worked hard to develop strong muscles through weight lifting, so my friends and family told me I needed to ""tone"" my body.  I worked hard to build muscle, but I couldn't figure out how to maintain that muscle in a healthy way that would not make me feel ""bulky"".  After years of feeling frustrated and self conscious, I finally took a personal trainer class. The instructor encouraged me to focus on healthy eating and a good strength training routine, which I had been trying to do on my own but was struggling with the results. The trainer showed me how to mix muscle with a healthy diet to reach my strength goals without feeling ""bulky"".  The change in mindset and learning how to maintain a healthy lifestyle has given me a sense of peace and confidence that I had been searching for years.

We all go through slumps in our careers from time to time, it's part of the journey, and it's important to stay positive. I'd like to offer you some supportive listening, and to suggest some things you can do to grow and develop professionally. One great way to grow and develop professionally is to deepen your knowledge on a particular topic. This could be through books, online courses, professional development courses, or connections to people who know more than you do on that topic. Take the time to research what would help you grow and what you need to learn, then schedule some time to invest in that direction.Another way to grow and develop professionally is to invest in yourself by taking on new responsibilities. Volunteer for a new project or team. Take on a bigger piece of work, or do a larger project for someone else. You could also consider a new role at your company, or starting your own side project that you could do on the side, but that will still be a meaningful investment of time and energy. Finally, it's also important to invest in your professional network. Make sure you're engaged with your colleagues, and reach out to other experts you",1,1.62035369873047

I’ve been in your shoes, and here’s what I’ve found to be helpful. First, take a step back and evaluate where you are in your career. What do you want out of a career in your 20s and 30s? Is it something that’s highly specialized or a master’s degree and specialized job that will get you there? I’m not saying you can’t or shouldn’t be specialized – I did that – but there are always options. And by options, I mean you can go back to school, uplevel, or both. Second, get outside opinions and read stuff by Ted open discussions and this. Third, assess your skills and see where you could use some development. A great example of this would be switching from bi-weekly to monthly team meetings. I could see myself growing in my ability to facilitate, teach others, and have good notes, and I imagine there are other areas like that. There’s a TON of overlap here – so take some time to think about this and reach out if you need someone to bounce ideas off of. I’m here if you ever want",1,0.580793440341949

The best way to get past that is to just take things one step at a time. Start with a local casual meet up at a bar or coffee shop. You can use the time to get to know each other over a coffee and some conversation starters in case you want to move to a more personal setting. Once you’re feeling more at ease, you can move on to something a little more casual like happy hours or events that are themed around things you both like. If you still want a bit more support, there are lots of services like meetup that can help you find events around your interests. The more you put yourself out there and do things organically, the easier it will be to meet new people. And while it’s important to be yourself, you should also listen to and respect your own values and body language. If you feel like someone is pressuring you into a conversation that isn’t authentic or feels too fast or too one-sided, then you can feel free to say “I’m not sure we’re on the same page here, I’d love to keep talking but I’m not feeling great and need to go”.

6,Your partner is feeling stressed about their workload. Provide a response that shows empathy and offers reassurance.,"I can see how you’re feeling stressed. It can be hard to know how you are perceived by your boss and coworkers and how your work is going to be assessed. I’ll be honest with you, I’ve had my moments where I felt I was drowning in my work too. However, what helps me feel good is knowing that I have a partner in this that cares for me and is pulling for me. I have so many people that care about me and want me to feel good. That support helps me stay present and engaged and not get so overwhelmed. I’d love to hear more about your experience today. Can I ask how your colleague responded to your question? It can be tricky to stay in tune when you are in the middle of something and need to “be in it.” My best piece of advice on this front is to write things down and put “conversation stamps” on email chains.  When I have an email chain open, it will go into my conversation  box so I can step back and reflect.

I’m here if you need to vent or talk through anything. I’m here if you need to get out of your head and get active again.Providing the above response demonstrates an understanding of your partner’s feelings and values. It shows that you are listening and communicate empathy. It’s okay to admit that you might be under the weather too, and that shows you understand your partner’s needs. It’s also important to let your partner know that you’re there for them if they do need to get out of their head, or that you’re willing to step in and help get business launched. When responding to a request for reassurance, be specific and tell your partner that you’re here for them. It could sound something like “I’m happy to help with anything you’re working on, or help create space to think about what I can do differently to support you. Let me",1,-0.432730138301849

I can imagine it feels confusing and unsettling. I’d like to share a few things to keep in mind as you navigate this time.First, it’s completely natural to grieve the relationship and be angry, feeling like your whole world has fallen apart. And while it might feel like there’s nothing to hold on to, this kind of grief often passes.Second, it’s entirely normal to want to give up and escape the pain and not want to feel that pain anymore. I don’t want to go through the pain of a breakup, but I know it’s necessary to heal. I remember thinking there wasn’t a reason to get out of bed some days. The pain is so deep I sometimes wonder how I made it through each day. But then I realize I woke up and I forced myself to function. And then I remember I got out of bed. And now I am here.Let yourself feel all of these emotions. Let yourself process them. You don’t have to put one foot in front of the other or move forward.

First, it’s important to recognize where you’re starting from and that you aren’t overwhelmed by a small challenge. I’ve worked with many people that feel overwhelmed in the first 90 days of starting a new job. You can usually anticipate when you will feel overwhelmed, which is helpful in planning your response. I also recommend being purposeful with your time and being intentional with whom you spend your time. Sometimes you just need to cut loose from a task or align yourself with the goal to fully engage in what needs to be accomplished. Try prioritizing a few action items that you can accomplish in the next few days to give yourself a sense of accomplishment and ownership. If you need additional assistance, I recommend connecting with your manager to see if you can utilize any resources at work. If your manager is also feeling overwhelmed, there may be a team meeting or a different volunteer shift that you can participate in to help pass some of the burden along.",1,2.27241659164429

I'd like to talk through some ways that you can approach conflict, and some ways that you can practice them as well. It sounds like this friend means a lot to you. Part of what is so special about friendship is that it's sometimes hard to know when you are crossing lines with each other and it's ok to have a healthy dialog to try and work through that. I'd like to offer a different perspective. When I was your age, my brother and I sometimes got into fights. He'd argue with me and I'd get upset and fight back. I'd think he was just being difficult.

31,Your child is upset about a fight they had with a friend. Offer support and guidance on resolving conflict.,"I am concerned that your child is still experiencing the after-effects of the conflict they had with their friend. It’s important to remember that children process information and external events differently. They may have opinions that they want to voice but don’t understand the implications of how their actions will impact others, and they may interpret your actions differently than you intended. Recognize that they may be experiencing fear and anxiety and provide space for them to share their feelings, validate their emotions, and seek guidance on how to cope and resolve their feelings in healthy ways. Sometimes conflict is not avoidable, and healthy conflict resolution is an opportunity to teach important life skills.  Repeatedly avoiding conflict or allowing conflict to persist or escalate can impact a person’s social and emotional development. When conflict occurs, it is important to acknowledge that feelings may be hurt and model how to express and manage emotions constructively. If there are patterns of repeated conflict, it is important to address the underlying concerns.Taking time to reflect and understand the root of the conflict is important. It is not uncommon for there to be a mixture of emotions, and addressing the root cause requires identifying what the conflict is actually about, not just the surface level issues that are being highlighted.",3,1.25695896148682

I know that when we adults get upset with each other, it’s important we try to remember to stay calm and respectful. When we do have feelings that get triggered, it’s important to check in with ourselves to make sure our responses are what we want. When I say check in, I mean really just to get a sense of where our emotions are coming from. Sometimes that help us understand our actions or responses to what is happening around us. If we are being reckless or rash, I know it’s important for us to pause and take a breath, and work on being more mindful of how our words or actions impact people. And if our emotions are getting triggered, I know it’s important for me to take time for myself to self-soothe too. That to me looks like maybe trying a short period of mediation, to try to get some clarity in what was happening or what might happen in the future.

Work-life balance has been a common theme of mine since we started this new job.  I've been struggling with this concept as well for years and having to reset and redefine the term.  If we look at work-life balance from the dictionary definition, then it is a state of being equal or even-keeled and well-balanced.  I believe there are times in our lives where this is more of a state of mind than a trait that can be physically switched on or off.  Our brains help to define how we feel with this perspective.  At work, it feels like I'm working as hard as possible to cover all areas of work but in many ways I am just guessing what work and life should feel like.  In my typical, bubbly personality, I sometimes throw life situations or assignments under the bus with enthusiasm, not always thinking about how that may come across to those around me.

I try to block out time for myself. I have a morning where I completely disconnect from work. I put away my work phone and don’t respond to any work emails. I have some personal emails I need to respond to, but those can be done later that day. Block out at least 30 minutes for yourself first thing in the morning or at night after kids are in bed. I also schedule time with my spouse. I set aside “date night” time a couple times a month. This could be a time to meet up for coffee, or going out for a nice meal or just staying home and doing activities we have never done. This time for us is our time to reconnect and remind ourselves how amazing we are to each other. I also remove myself from work overloads.

Where are you thinking and feeling like you need to dig deep?2. Determine what you need to get back into a good balance. What do you need? What does your team need? Do you need more sleep? An hour here and there? A block of time? Rest? Do you need a holiday? Redo your duties with a fresh pair of eyes? 3. Prioritize your actions. Which of these do you need to commit to for the next week? Next two weeks? What does that look like in your calendar and time? List is on the calendar. Plan for it.4. Take action.

Balance is important. I've been on both sides of this equation. I've been the one feeling overwhelmed. I've also been the one responsible for creating some semblance of work-life balance. When I was younger, I felt like a "" workaholic"" or that I had to give it all in because my salary was too low to put money away. Truthfully, I think it was part of my delayed development at the time. I had come out of school with relatively no savings, and I needed to work because I didn't have any other financial resources. With experience, I was able to set expectations in the beginning of my career as to how I wanted to manage that and now the stress and chaos of everyday life take precedent. That being said, we all have different goals and expectations. The first piece is validating that you feel overwhelmed. This can come from many sources and I see several situations where this comes up in my work. 1) The scope of the projects feel too large, or 2) you don't have the bandwidth to keep up with the projects that are piling up and feel like you are drowning.

Sometimes it feels like we have too many responsibilities that conflict with each other. One way to help with work-life balance is by setting time aside for relaxation and rejuvenation. That could mean scheduling a date with friends or family, or taking time to focus on personal interests. Also, it’s okay to ask for help. When I was feeling overwhelmed, taking some time off to focus on things that make me happy helped me feel more in control. In addition, setting time aside for stress relief can help give me some space from my demanding responsibilities. Lastly, I believe in having a healthy work-life balance. At home, I may work more hours, but that does not mean I work better. My family should be a priority, and also giving my job my all. My work and family should complement one another, and not overtake one another. I’m thankful for my work and feel like it has great impact on the world, but I also need to be honest with myself that I do have limits and that it is ok to ask for help when I need it.",1,1.41144418716431

Social anxiety can be very scary. However, understanding what is causing your anxiety and developing tools to cope can make it easier to attend social events in the future. Here are some of the reasons you may feel anxious: 1. You’re worried about what people think of you. But you’re the only one who can control this. So, you can practice talking to yourself in your head about what you like and don’t like about how you dress, speak and behave. For example, you can say to yourself, “I don’t know if I should change that habit I have of raising my voice. I may scare people away with my loud tone.” 2. You’re worried about disappointing people. But that’s not a good enough reason to avoid doing things. If you can’t handle the situation well, then it’s likely you won’t put that energy into the next experience either.

What have you learned from this? Maybe you noticed that you would start to feel anxious about the gathering towards the end of the planning. I recommend that you pause and consider this. I am also concerned that there is a large gap of 7 days between the gathering I’m referring to and your initial response. This may have made you feel anxious. I suggest that you think of this another way. It could be a form of the upcoming gathering coming up. You may want to consider that it could help to put this in perspective.

83,A relative is feeling anxious about attending a social gathering. Provide a response that offers comfort and strategies to manage social anxiety.,"It’s completely normal to feel anxious when facing social situations, even small social gatherings. Many people feel anxious when they first meet new people. In most social settings, being anxious is not unusual or abnormal, and usually can be easily managed. While it is true that no one expects you to be social during the holidays, it’s not uncommon for people to bring friends and family. This makes it easier for you to connect with people and practice your conversation skills.If this anxiety is interfering with your ability to enjoy the holidays and see your friends, family and neighbors, I would encourage you to discuss your worries with your therapist, as many times your anxiety is manageable. Talking with your therapist can also help you identify your strategies for managing your anxiety so you can feel prepared and have the confidence you need to be social. Here are some strategies to help manage social anxiety:Be yourself, and be honest with yourself. If you always give overly-politically answers, or never express your opinions, your anxiety may escalate because you don’t know how to respond, or even worse, you believe you aren’t prepared to respond and then you’re even more anxious.

Is it a genuine cause for concern, or are they just socially anxious? In some situations, there can be a fine line between the two. In other words, maybe they are just being extra cautious about the people they interact with, and their anxiety is warranted.In the instance that they are truly anxious, you can provide some reassurance that you are there to help support them. This can help them feel more at ease and alleviate some of their uncertainty. Next, I’d suggest reviewing the “dos” and “don’ts” of mingling with others. This means ensuring they are attending to the conversation, and not losing their train of thought. If they are worried about their shoes and they leave them at the door, that’s likely going to interfere with their ability to be themselves and interact comfortably. Some social anxiety can be managed by ensuring they’re moving around and speaking to different people. The more exposure they have to different conversations and scenarios, the more comfortable they’ll feel.Overall, I’d encourage them to think of someone they may want to spend more time with.

Provide a response that shows understanding and suggests ways to find support.,"I am so sorry that you are struggling with these responsibilities. While balancing work and caregiving can feel overwhelming, there are things you can try to find a balance.First, I recommend speaking with your manager. Ideally you would speak with them before making a plan in an attempt to prevent overloading yourself. That way they can help to identify supportive resources within your work that could provide the assistance you need. Next, I encourage you to consider making a list of things that help you find balance. Examples might be getting out in nature, being around pets, exercising, and taking time for yourself.I also encourage you to seek out other forms of support, like seeing a counselor or finding a therapist that you feel comfortable with. These additional supports could provide additional strategies to help you feel more balanced.Ultimately, it is so important that you seek support as you try to balance caregiving and work responsibilities.

In December, I had my yearly check up and my cardiologist felt that my blood pressure was a little too high for comfort, so he recommended I see an interventional cardiologist for a coronary angiogram. The angiogram confirmed that my blood pressure was a little high due to the complete blockage of my coronary artery. I was put on a 48 hour fast until the  angiogram to minimize fluid in my blood stream as it would slow the procedure, but that was my secondary concern. It is a good thing that I went for the check up as I would not have known of this potential risk until it was too late.

I have found that communication and being patient with my neighbor has helped me feel better.

It might be beneficial to talk with my neighbor about how I feel, and my expectations to see if we can identify where I have been interpreted incorrectly, or if I am just misunderstanding. Here are some communication suggestions. I would suggest talking with them as a group, if I find that works better for me. When we get into arguments, it is usually because we are feeling defensive, and I can see how someone could perceive my neighbor as being defensive. Being clear about what you expect from them and checking in with yourself, to see if you are interpreting things incorrectly would be helpful.

We all need to practice self-care and compassion for our own well-being as well as for our neighbor. Anxiety from conflict can not only bring up uncomfortable emotions, but also cause physical symptoms.So here’s a supportive thought - find a way to connect with your neighbor outside of this conflict to stay connected - that you love them, and they love you. You are both human, and likely have similar issues with loved ones in your lives, so when you have opportunities, connect with them on those topics. You might offer space or time for them to tell their side of a conflict. Then if a next conflict arises, you’re more equipped to manage it with empathy, and also be able to identify where you may have pushed too hard or not far enough. Sometimes the best we can do in situations like this is to try and remain calm, keep an eye out for red flags, and speak up when we need to for our own self-care, safety, and peace of mind.

We are also feeling the effects in our own lives right now, with many of us staying home longer, unable to meet our usual social contacts and routines, and feeling anxious about the future and uncertain about what the future may hold.With all of this in mind, I am going to share with you how I am trying to think positively about the future, and what I am doing to help create a positive outlook, so that I can stay hopeful and focused on what I can do to contribute and contribute to the solutions.Firstly, I am ensuring I am staying up to date with current affairs and learning what I can about what is happening in the world around me",3,0.423453062772751

Provide a response that shows empathy, offers support, and encourages a healthy self-image.","I can empathize with your friend's struggle with body image issues. As someone who struggled with my own body image for much of my life, I know how damaging those feelings can be. Even though I've moved past those feelings, I can understand how hard it can be to live with a body you don't feel comfortable in. However, I encourage them to remember that their body image is their responsibility, not anyone else's. It's important to take some steps to focus their attention on the positive things about their body. For example, perhaps they can focus on all the hard work they've done to improve their health by getting in shape or managing their diabetes. By consciously shifting their focus, I hope they'll begin to see their body in a more positive light. It's also important to be kind to themselves. If someone can always be kind to themselves, it can help them better take care of their body and mind. This means giving them the freedom they deserve, as well as giving them compassion for their struggles. I think they should make some changes in their routine to take better care of their health. For example, perhaps they can add activities that give them more confidence, like yoga or a strength training class. They should also",1,2.23103308677673

It can be difficult to find the balance between being together and doing your own thing.

It can feel like chaos when you are trying to have a conversation but there will likely be several people who step up to try and calm you down. The hard part of all of this is it really doesn’t change who that person is. You may still need to check in with that person a bit further to ensure things are calm before moving forward.

I also know that as your children grow and are more self-sufficient, they might find it difficult to return to your home to have dinner with you and your partner. This can create a sense of loneliness and a feeling that the family unit is not cohesive or present.  First, I recommend that you discuss these concerns with your partner.  See if you can set some time aside to sit down with him/her and express your feelings of frustration. Perhaps discuss how you feel that you are the go-to for everyone in the family, yet don’t feel like you are getting the same in return.

If you find you still find yourself struggling with too many tasks you could consider looking into self-care practices like planning time for yourself to rest, practicing meditation, attending a counseling session, seeking help from other people who are having success in your role who could provide you with some accountability and support to help you too.I hope you are able to take care of yourself in the face of this new challenge, and I hope to see you at your best as we move into the rest of this year.",2,3.16903638839722

Setting aside some time each day to do the most important things on that list, like responding to emails, writing a paper, or doing an exercise for their major project. If their biggest distraction is school-related, try to spend time away from that stimulus to avoid being tempted. Some weekends might need to be spent away from all of their activities and potentially family time to allow them to process the week.

You have to find a good balance where you do not burn yourself out with activities but still maintain some semblance of balance. One way to alleviate some of this stress, and try to keep yourself sane through it all, is to try to find some balance within the academic workload by minimizing extracurricular activities or chunking out the workload over shorter time periods to increase your ability to complete the work. This means you have to pick and choose the few activities that can be done in a shorter timeframe rather than trying to tackle the whole list in one go. Remember to give yourself time to recharge or decompress as this can help to reduce the stress levels the next time you have a major project. Another way to manage your stress is to set aside time everyday to tackle the most difficult or urgent tasks, such as studying for an exam or writing a critical essay.

Plan ahead as much as possible by completing my most important tasks for the day/week prior to the deadline. In doing so, I don't feel as much like I'm scrambling at the last minute. 2. Prioritize my list of tasks by level of importance. Once I've identified the most important tasks, I focus all of my energy on completing them. I also try to ensure that the lower priority tasks are still completed, but I focus less of my energy on them. I do this because it helps me feel more accomplished at the end of the day. 3. Spend some time relaxing and letting go of my stress. I know that this is easier said than done, but even 20 minutes of deep breathing helps me to regain a sense of calm and peace.

I can understand how social media can amplify worries and create a feeling of connection with others who are facing the same struggles. I want to help provide you with some thoughts that can help you process what’s going on and maybe consider some next steps. The first step is to recognize how you are feeling about things. A lot of people start with “oh my god, I’ve got to delete social media altogether” but at a fundamental level this is a reaction from you which does not stop the feelings. Some useful tools are the Empathy Dissolves tool which helps you really notice how you’re feeling without attaching judgements or how to create distance. So just some self-reflection.In addition, I suggest setting a time each day or just in the evening where you can tune into the online social media world (although also look at your Tweets, Facebook etc when you need to tune out too!). This can be all-consuming. You can consciously consider you want to respond to one thing today, and only one thing, then you can’t be interrupted.

Social media use can certainly impact someone's mental health if they are seeking out negative social comparisons or feeling the need to spend too much time on their device. As someone who struggles with social anxiety, I often feel compelled to watch what I share or seek out other peoples posts that could trigger my fear.

I have two suggestions for meeting new people.  One, as you start to get more adjusted to your new location, I suggest you try a cooking class - they're a great way to get to know people. And second, I also suggest you go to meetup.com and search through the events in your new city.  I'm sure you will meet new people that way.  When meeting new people, a great icebreaker is to ask what their favorite author or book is.  That will get the conversation going and allows you to discuss something you've both shared an interest in.",4,1.34777092933655

I hope this makes you feel less alone and that you can connect with others going through the same thing.  I am a fellow sufferer of anxiety but am in a much better place today than I have been lately.  What I suggest is getting clear with yourself and write down your triggers in a journal.  A trigger is any thought, feeling or behavior that reminds you of your anxious thoughts. I would start by saying write down your anxious thoughts and begin to question them.  Examine the content and dig deep to see why they are there.  Are they a way of life I grew up with?  Are they from my childhood? (Remember that our early experiences can have a profound impact on our adult development.) What does it tell us about your unconscious - that you’re in it?

I’ve heard CBT and SSRI meds can be helpful, but I’ve also read that it can be hard to commit to the long-term changes required. One thing I found helpful was setting small, achievable goals. An example of that is – I’d have these thoughts about “oh, I need to start meditating, but I don’t know how – if I just started I’d stop!”. I started small and found a youtube series on a friend’s recommendation that was short and sweet – it made me think about the fact that I could say “yes, I can make space and time for myself”, which was a great feeling. The mindfulness/meditation community is also really helpful for me.

You’re probably the most aware of your surroundings. I have some tips if this is a problem for you. I also suggest checking into a supportive therapist and medication if you’ve been struggling with anxiety for a long time. I had a childhood friend with anxiety, and it helped me realize that everyone feels anxious sometimes and its not always a big deal. Some situations might be more stressful for her but everyone is different. One of the things I noticed is that we did different things to cope. One, I would go out and try new things that might raise my stress levels. Like public speaking or new social settings. When I would be anxious I would plan activities I could pursue to reduce it. This could be seeing a therapist or my go to snack was apple and peanut butter. Anxiety is just an emotion and sometimes its in the body.

I do not need to think my way through or figure everything out ahead of time and get frustrated when it doesn't always work out the way I want.

I can completely relate to the emotions you’re feeling. My own response when I first received a rejection was very similar. I went through a few cycles of feeling bummed out, then angry, and then learned from it and actually understood why it didn’t work for me.There is no “right” reason for why something didn’t work. That’s part of what I’ve learned from my time as a personal trainer. No two people respond the same way to the same exercises or interventions. Even someone who’s same size and shape or conditioning level will respond differently to the same program depending on their goals, weaknesses, personal characteristics, and recovery capacities. No program works for everyone. I truly believe that. But, what works for someone is different than what works for me, or that someone else. It’s not about accepting that, but understanding it. Knowing that allows me to have more confidence that I’ve got a good grasp on what would work for someone else and it’s allowed me to be more confident in my ability to take what I learn and apply it to what would work best for me.

It helped to think about my failures as learning experiences and things that made me a better person.

It can be helpful to remind them that they have changed schools before and that it was not a big deal. Second, remind them that they can make some good friends at this new school.  If they are a bit nervous about making friends, consider having them join some extracurricular clubs, like tennis or debating. These can help them make friends. If that doesn't help, consider taking them to school a few days early so that they can check out their classes and meet some of their classmates. It can be helpful to feel like they are part of the school community before school starts. If they need additional help, the school may have specialists in social-emotional learning or social skills development.

If you are able, try to engage in some time to be by yourself so that you can separate the work stress from the caregiving stress.  I also recommend finding people outside of work who can help you process the caregiving work and being open to asking for help.

While balancing many responsibilities can be stressful, it is also important to be mindful of prioritizing the needs of one role over another.

Additionally, taking action on a plan to step back from time-sensitive projects can help to free up your time so that you can focus on and attend to your personal responsibilities first. If you do need to spend time on work-related responsibilities, I suggest structuring them with a personal element to support you so you feel connected and able to spend focused time on work-related topics.

On the days I’m working on my own, I make sure to prioritize activities that help me stay on track - for me, this often means reading a good book or engaging in a research project.

I want you to know that I'm thinking of you during this difficult time. My heart goes out to all the families impacted, and the firefighters and first responders who are working so hard.With all of that said, I want to re-emphasize that forest fires are something that are a concern for all of us, not just those impacted directly by this fire. This disaster is just one example of a longer term trend in California and the West.  The state has a serious forest fire problem that is not only dangerous for those directly affected, but also can result in issues with air quality and ecosystem destruction. Wildfire suppression costs are really starting to add up, as we are seeing with this disaster. It costs about $3 billion each year, with much of this money coming from a mandatory fire insurance program. We can't just keep doing more of the same. We need to make some very difficult decisions and prioritize better. We also need the public to make a positive impact. I think the best way to help is to speak up.

Offer support and guidance on resolving conflict.,"Even though I would prefer not to see my children fight, I see the positive value in teaching them to navigate conflict in healthy ways.  If I help my child to understand the motivations for why they did not succeed in this argument, we will have a better foundation for exploring what changes need to be made to improve their next debate. What were they not able to communicate effectively? What skills could they use to better explain their position? * In our discussions about this conflict, I will also give them constructive feedback about their language and tone, and emphasize that being calm during an argument is sometimes as important as being passionate.  They should take this lesson into life in a similar way.  When someone is being unkind, or condescending, or irrational, or emotional, or belittling, or overtly threatening, or just plain difficult -- how can we stay calm while acknowledging the effect that their behavior is having on our feelings?  It is easy to get emotional ourselves during conflict!* This is also an opportunity for my child to practice setting boundaries.

It's so easy for these situations to go to a bad place and I'm worried that this is the start of a larger issue that is hard to solve. Our friendship has always been so important to me, so I'm struggling with how I'm going to handle this. The difficult part of this for me, is that I don’t think the disagreement was completely fair on both sides. My daughter feels like they were able to articulate their point of view very clearly but I think they may have been a bit frustrated with my daughter for not really listening, for not paying attention or for not being empathetic. She also shared with me that she was asked a question, where she had to tell me how she felt, and while she feels she did a good job explaining her point of view, I can tell she was nervous and concerned that I was going to disagree with her, which made it very hard to express her emotions fully.

When this happens I'm wondering if this is happening to you too? While there's certainly some validity to the idea that I have expectations that are hard to match, there's also a lot of that could come from not taking enough time to let people know how I'm feeling in more thoughtful moments. So I'm wondering if you have ever felt frustrated because of not being able to explain more fully how you're feeling, and how people respond to that?When I feel like a person's not being thoughtful and empathetic, I tend to worry that they just don't care enough to try. In the past it's been very important to me to explain myself. I would try to list out the pros and cons, or draw a flowchart if I didn't feel able to speak clearly. This seemed to work fine up until a point, though now I feel like I'm at the end of my rope with things that I feel like I haven't gotten a great response to that - sometimes I'm also trying to express other things that I don't think get a great response either.

Here are a few resources I’ve used in the past. Some resources for managing anxiety:1. The Power of Vulnerability: It’s not easy to be open and share your struggles. But, it’s the only way to grow as a person and gain perspective. 2. Ask for What You Want: Set a goal/vision board for yourself and write down a list of goals that you want to work towards. Have a clear plan in place that you can work towards.3. I Am Not My Worst Judge: As a result of point 2, I started putting myself in new situations where I would do things that scared me.

One thing I've found useful is understanding my anxiety triggers - typically it's small things, and once I work out what they are I'm able to be more prepared and not let them get to me as much. I've also learnt that I can't control other people, but I can control my reaction to them and my own mental health is more important so I've worked on having fewer expectations of people. Having anxiety also makes me a more empathetic person. When I have good days I try to remember how it feels to have it bad and think back to when I was a kid and how I've always been a bit of an over-analyser, and try to channel that now - trying to see things from the other person's perspective and perhaps even recognising if I'm being a bit over-sensitive.

65,A coworker is feeling overwhelmed with work-life balance. Offer a supportive response and suggest strategies to find equilibrium.,"I’m glad to hear that you’re feeling overwhelmed.  It sounds like you’re doing your best to juggle the competing demands on your time and personal priorities.  I’m not an expert, but I do know that it’s possible to feel overwhelmed in a variety of ways, and it’s ok to take a step back, think about it, and prioritize the things that are most important to you.  That said, I can offer some thoughts on strategies that might help you find that balance: 1. Make sure you set time aside for you. This could be in the form of time in the morning or in the evening, or it could be in blocks during the day. The important part is that you create a space where you can be mindful and have “me” time. I think this is super important, and it gives you a chance to recharge and refocus your energy. 2. Work hard on scheduling your time. This might mean scheduling in specific activities or it could mean thinking about “how” you want to spend your time. For example, if you’re someone who’s prone to putting in a lot of hours, try to resist the urge to stay later so",3,1.46051931381226

I feel like there are some things I can think of to help you find some balance and clarity: 1) Diving into work that's stressful or overwhelming to help get caught up on things.  Not only does it help you get back into a flow of productivity it will also give you a sense of achievement that you accomplished a high stress task at work that needed attention.  It can also give you a sense of a sense of pride for what you accomplished.  2) Meeting with colleagues to decompress or relax.  It can be helpful to pick a colleague that you trust and can brainstorm with about how you are feeling.  You can say something as simple as ""I am feeling like I am not getting everything done so I am bouncing between different tasks and tasks feeling like I am behind, I want to get stuff done and focused, I feel like I am juggling too many things.

One effective strategy for handling high volume work is to take personal time on days that I have a lot of work, or am overly busy. It was hard to do this at first, but now I am much better able to handle being busy and work life balance is improved. It’s also important to carve out time for the things that make me feel healthy and energized. I take a daily walk with my dog, meditate, exercise, and spend time with my kids. By doing these things I feel more ready to tackle work when I need to be responsive. When I’m feeling overwhelmed I take a step back and acknowledge it, step away, and try to carve out time to refocus.I also recognize that there is more than one way to create work life balance.

Expressing things I am feeling and being true to myself.  I'm still working on doing this for myself.  My wife makes me think differently about this.  2.

Offer words of understanding and encouragement to learn from the experience.,"It's never a comfortable feeling when you make a mistake in your work and I know it's not something you want to feel. It's one thing to acknowledge your mistake and also reflective on how you can do better in the future. Firstly, ensure that you acknowledge what went wrong, why and seek to understand your own actions and any considerations you might have had at the time. Secondly, reflect and understand what actions you can take to prevent this in the future.  If I could offer some advice - try to avoid the tendency to do it yourself as you need to be mindful of the pressure you are under.  It would have been good to get input from peers or more senior colleagues. If you are working with a manager, find a quiet moment and share the situation with them and try to identify any further support or coaching you may need.  Finally, reflect on what you can do to move forward and develop as a result.  Thank the colleague for sharing their views and taking ownership of the situation.

95,Your partner shares their fear of public speaking. Offer a response that offers comfort and suggests techniques to manage anxiety.,"I have had experience with public speaking anxiety from my college days. I am in the public sector and I had to speak in front of groups all the time. There were many reasons for my nervousness. I learned to manage my anxiety. If I started to get anxious, I took a deep breath and told myself to remember the audience - that they were there to listen and hear my message. What helps me the most is to use my notes. When I am nervous, I start to forget things. I look at my notes to refresh my memory. I also learn to talk a lot slower when I am nervous. I slow my rate of speech down to a comfortable level. One thing that helps me be relaxed is  to focus on my goal. I prepare and give myself a goal for what I am going to talk about. I also prepare a takeaway message for my audience. Then, when I get nervous, I just remember that goal. I am confident that I will be able to give you the confidence you need to speak up in front of your audience. I am also confident that your message to the audience will be heard and received with enthusiasm. Remember to breathe and take a deep breath.",2,1.21282088756561

I want to help my partner help you.  One thing I’ve done when I’m feeling nervous is to picture my audience in their underwear.  I haven’t been great at that, but it’s a start.  Another thing is to make a list of techniques that I’m going to use.  One is deep breathing.  I’m going to try that.  Another is to remember a joke I recently told.

It helped to have an easy audience to focus on. It helped to clearly define my goals for the presentation and not get distracted. I had to ensure I had the main points and agenda covered so I could pace myself.  I found the trick was to focus on what was to be accomplished and not think about potential missteps.  I mustered some energy when I had to - I made eye contact and acted confident to start with.  I let the nerves subside. I was in control.  Then I let it happen - let myself forget everything I had been planning for months. I think it helps to remind myself that most everyone has an introvert side,  and it's okay if they don't like being in the spotlight.  Acknowledge that even if you don't like having to speak in public,  it's often a necessary part of being an effective leader.

I know making new friends can be challenging and making new friends in a new school can be even more challenging.  However,  I do have a few suggestions to help make new friends.First, ask your child if they would like me to help them practice their new conversation skills.  This will help give them confidence they can make conversation with different adults and peers.  While they are practicing, you can come up with an adult conversation topic they could use as a starter.  If they don’t know any other children that start with them at the new school, a conversation starter could be “What is your favorite color?”.  Another conversation starter could be  “Do you prefer hot or cold weather?”.  Make sure you practice those conversations starters with a variety of adults and peers to increase their confidence.If they have a conversation starter, I can assist them in finding others that might be interested in the conversation starter.  I would encourage them to try a few different ways to see if anyone is interested.  As a last resort, they can go to a few kids they know and practice their conversation starters.

It is perfectly ok to feel a little anxious about it.  Here are some tips to consider, First, think about how your child is starting to form friendships at home.  What are some qualities or things that your child shares with those friends that he may not share with his friends at school?  Ask him about this.  Second, think about who you have confidence your child will make friends with, maybe someone on his sports team?   Ask your child to introduce you to this person.  Third, find a friendly adult that you trust to help your child get comfortable talking to people.  This could be a relative or a teacher.  Ask that person to be a little more available to your child for support and advice.Finally, invite the school to a social event at your house like a pool party or pizza party.  Ask the principal and other important people in your child's life for support in getting this event planned and make sure to invite your friends also.

I’m a strong person and I usually bounce back quickly. If I’m feeling sad or depressed for a long time, I know I should talk to someone. I can handle difficult situations now. I feel better prepared for future times when I might need help. It helps to create plans for how I want to respond or feel when something hard happens.

Offer a supportive response and suggest communication strategies to resolve the issue.,"I can certainly relate to feeling frustrated with a neighbor. I’ve also found that a neighbor’s behavior, although often frustrating, is not entirely within my control. One suggestion to help alleviate the conflict is to communicate with the other neighbor to learn more about their side of the story. This may help better understand the roots of the conflict and what you can do in the moment to be a better neighbor. When I’m feeling frustrated or if I see something out of the ordinary that I’m concerned about, I immediately talk to the person that I believe it is impacting.

Offer support, reassurance, and remind them that the journey is more important than the outcome.","Hey there, thanks for sharing your fear. Fear of failure is one that I have faced many times as a coach and a former competitor in myself. The most effective way I have seen people process this is one that balances the individuality of their own feelings and needs with the collective mindset of the group. It is incredibly hard to strike that balance and to start being a member of the group. In that context, I would focus on the language we’ve already been practicing to build confidence. I’ve had some success with language like “Even though I might not be completely prepared, I will give it everything I have” and also “I am feeling ok with my performance even though I didn’t perform exactly as I wanted” I hope this helps you today. -Chris",3,-0.318703711032867

While we can’t fully understand the situations around us, I hope we can all seek to understand one another better and develop strategies for moving forward together. When family dynamics are frustrating I often find that a few different strategies can be effective. First, it’s helpful to check in with the people involved to see how they are feeling. Do they have any questions or reflections they would like to share? By listening to those around us we gain insight into what is going well and where there is uncertainty or challenges. Second, I like to seek input from others that can offer a different perspective. If I’m struggling with a challenging family situation I will often seek advice from friends, especially if they have a different perspective to offer. In many cases, I’ve learned that other people’s opinions have really helped me get a different perspective.Ultimately, I think that working together as a family to reflect, check in, and develop strategies is helpful.",3,1.88923573493958

Provide a response that offers empathy, suggests time management techniques, and emphasizes the importance of self-care.","First, let me validate that your sibling is feeling overwhelmed.  When our children feel overloaded, it's normal for them to feel like their plate is not empty enough and consequently not like they are getting everything done they need to.  They often internalize and think, ""I'm not able to participate fully in any of these things, and that's why my grades are suffering"" or ""I'm not able to get things done because I'm not meeting the other demands on my time.""  I have to tell you, those are the excuses, and you need to let them go.  You are not the one doing all the things.  They are trying hard and getting good grades and meeting their obligations and volunteering and what have you.  They do not need to be overwhelmed.With that being said, I'm wondering if you could help your sibling with some time management techniques.  I see myself as being rather good at managing my time, and I know that I could be better if I really pushed myself and set aside blocks of time for reflection and planning and regular scheduling.

As a fellow part-time student I know how busy it can be to find a good balance between both activities and studies. It’s hard to know when you can dedicate yourself fully to one area without overdoing it in another.First of all, I think it’s super important to look after yourself! I don’t mean eating good food, showering regularly, doing your hair or whatever. I mean taking care of your physical self. It doesn’t matter if it’s rest, relaxing time, exercise or a nice bath, do what you need to do for yourself. Second, set some clear times aside for focus and study. I have my nights out planned well in advance (the next few weeks). I decided when the next batch of exams would be so I could focus on that. I’ve also made sure to take small breaks during the day to get lunch, walk around, go to the bathroom, etc. Sometimes I put my phone away too - no phone calls in the study time and really keep myself focused.",5,1.30633497238159
292,"Your sibling is feeling overwhelmed with balancing academics and extracurricular activities.

Taking on more activities creates more stress. I feel like you can't “have it all”, instead, you have to decide what is most important to you and pick your battles. You have to prioritize your work load and give yourself enough time to complete your commitments.  Another thing to consider is to take some time to focus on your own personal wellness.  Take time for you!  Investing in yourself makes it easier to invest in your team and family members.  Don’t forget that even though you feel completely drained at the end of the day, you have to treat yourself to a nice meal, run a bath, a movie, or a long soak in the tub with some really good book.  You have to remember that this job doesn’t define who you are.

To be successful in college, they need to multitask among different responsibilities while also balancing social and study time. I recommend they schedule “big blocks” of time in their schedule to complete projects and study. I also recommend setting aside time to handle important tasks independently (without checking email, texts, or social media). Another suggestion I have is to allow more time in their classes to attend office hours and ask clarifying questions to work through problems. I also recommend they prioritize and work on taking a step back from all their activities to give themselves a break. This should allow them to focus on their key tasks and spend less time on small tasks which are less important. Finally, I recommend they take time for self-care and recognize how they’re feeling and take steps to improve their mood.",5,4.50678491592407

Instead of just listing all my responsibilities, I can schedule in how much time I have to work on each of them. I schedule when to read class assignments to prepare for discussions or quizzing so that I am not spreading my workload too thin. I also block out time for time management and self care every day.

Grief often makes us feel as though we aren't in control of our emotions, and that we are incapable of doing certain things. But those are not always accurate perceptions. One activity I find helpful is to express my feelings through art. This allows me a new measure of control, and an outlet for all of my emotions, good and bad.

Offer a response that shows empathy, encourages self-reflection, and suggests potential avenues for growth or change.","When we experience feelings of inadequacy it's common to beat ourselves up, question our abilities and wonder why we were not able to produce something a bit more. Whether it's a fear of failure or perceived challenges, these are all self-sabotaging thoughts. I would like to invite you to dig deeper and consider whether your lack of self-esteem is impacting your ability to create the success you desire in your career. As humans, we are only able to experience the present and then project into the future. This leaves us with a limit on how we can interpret the ""what ifs"". Each day, we are faced with choices and opportunities to embrace new challenges, receive feedback and take ownership of our own development. If you feel that a perceived lack of success in a particular area has impacted on your emotions then this is a clear opportunity for you to explore areas of your personal development and apply the skills that you've learned. Many of us find this  process of working through our own self-sabotage as we're able to shine a light on these negative patterns and positively challenge how we view challenges in the future.  This is a hugely positive step for you and I'd be delighted to support you in this journey.",5,1.43769001960754

I do understand how frustrating it can be to feel as though you’re being undervalued and not feeling like you are giving your very best in what you believe is a contributing capacity.  These feelings of inadequacy can trickle through your confidence. I understand that even in this instance it seems as though these feelings are still rooted in some sense of uncertainty for your career.  As I’ve had the privilege of assisting many people to reflect on their unique purpose and strengths  I’m able to see your career path.  I think it is fair to say that your skill set and role has developed to the level that you feel these uncomfortable feelings. As I look at myself I realise how, for so long, I never  felt that I got acknowledged for contributing to the team.  While my role certainly improved with confidence and responsibility  I struggled with personal value and the potential to leave my footprint in the sector.

Now,  from a firm position of not being impacted by that feeling, I can also tell you that I have had this feeling many times before, and have a few suggestions to help me turn around and feel better about myself.

I encourage them to take a step back and think about where they are trying to measure themselves.  Our performance is often measured against other’s expectations; it is human nature to compare ourselves to others.  In situations like this, I encourage them to explore the reasons for their feelings of inadequacy.  For example, if they are comparing their performance to someone else, I may question them on why they feel like they need to be perfect.  I ask them to explore where they may have unconsciously applied pressure to themselves in order to be good enough.

That way, the rest of the house will be picked up and maintained with a clean slate.When they are ready, they can pick up where they left off and focus on another task.

As your partner is feeling overwhelmed, make sure he always has a task to focus on and remember that he's more than capable of handling the workload.Like you, he also values his time and he's trying to juggle work, family, and household chores. Keep in mind that the household chores he has on his list have to be done before he starts to prioritize his tasks and he doesn’t need to do everything all at once. He will find a way to divide and conquer the larger projects. For example, he can tackle dusting his closets first because it’s a bigger area and it will help him be more efficient later when he cleans the rest of the house.

If it’s a good fit, you could share how you might have been in their position and work to validate that they’re in an emotionally charged situation that’s hard to control.  Here are some of my suggestions for supporting our child through this time:1.  Acknowledge their emotion and share your own. This can help calm your child and allow them to express their feelings.2.  Remind your child that conflict is part of growing up. Conflict is part of life. Accept that you can’t always have the answers or resolve conflict. 3.  Refocus from your child’s argument to a teaching moment. This can help validate the importance of listening, compromising, and finding common ground.4.  Be available for a follow up conversation.

32,Your child is upset about a fight they had with a friend. Offer support and guidance on resolving conflict.,"There are a number of ways that you can help your child to resolve conflict with friends.  The first is to offer guidance on how they can set aside the things that they are upset about, and still be a good friend to the person who is upsetting them.  For example, they could tell the other friend that they are frustrated about something, but that it's not a fair reflection on them as a friend to behave this way, and that they are disappointed they had to take this attitude towards them.  You can also offer guidance on how they should respond to this disappointment.  They should try and understand that this disappointment comes from the other person's misguided behavior, and they have to let go of that.  They should try to convey that they are disappointed, but that it is from their perspective, and they need to see the other person's side to understand how they may have been taken by surprise.  They could also offer that this may be a sign that the other person was over-reactig to their frustration, and that this would be something they need to be careful about in the future.  These responses can help your child manage their own emotions around a conflict they are having with a friend, and guide them into thinking more clearly and logically",2,1.82352983951569
33,Your child is upset about a fight they had with a friend. Offer support and guidance on resolving conflict.,"It sounds like your child is feeling a bit stressed about a fight they had with a friend at school today. It’s important to you to model positive conflict resolution skills and, if necessary, to practice how to manage conflict with your children. Let’s work on some tips to help your child manage their feelings more effectively. When a fight or conflict occurs: 1. Take some time away from the situation to calm down.2. Try to recall what triggered the conflict. 3. Take a deep breath and describe to you their feelings -  frustrated, worried, sad, etc.4. As they describe how they feel, help your child identify the feeling or feelings that are the most intense. 5. Think of how they might be feeling.  Confident  or helpless?  Regretful or upset? 6. Encourage them to express these feelings.  For example, if they feel frustrated, ask them “I notice that you are frustrated. Do you have a moment to explain what happened?”  7. Listen carefully to their response and be open to feedback.8. Where appropriate, let them know you’re there for them as they work to identify the",2,1.67094993591309
34,Your child is upset about a fight they had with a friend. Offer support and guidance on resolving conflict.,I can understand if you are feeling upset because you had a fight with your friend. We all have differences with people. People can bring out the best in us and they also can make us feel uncomfortable. I also think it is very important to understand different people have different personalities and  different ways of expressing them. I also think it is very important to understand how your friend is feeling as well. I can imagine being upset with someone can have a very different response than being happy about someone else. I also think it is very important to allow time for reflection so you can reflect on what was the best outcome of the situation and what your feelings around it. I think your questions reflect a thoughtful approach to moving forward. I would suggest taking the time to reflect on your thoughts and feelings. The holidays are a great time to refocus with family and friends. Lets try some mindfulness exercises in the morning before we head out. I hope you have a safe and Happy Holidays. I am sure this will be an opportunity to bring some perspective to your life.,2,-1.43814241886139

And I completely understand how you are feeling. I remember being in a very similar situation. And while it may have not seemed like a lot in the short-term, the feeling of disappointment can linger. That's why it's so important to take a step back and realize that this doesn't mean that you're not good at your job! You've worked hard, and so has everyone else that is being considered for this promotion. Have confidence in your abilities, and know that you're more than capable of learning the new responsibilities, and then excelling in those. The good news is, it doesn't necessarily take someone to take on more responsibilities to be viewed as a go-to person. If you put your best foot forward, took initiative to learn the new things that were being asked of you, and really made yourself indispensable to the team, then I truly believe you should be viewed that way! I think we both know that they're looking for someone who can take on a bigger scope of work - so it is up to you to keep putting yourself in those situations!

I agree that the business environment feels more uncertain than usual and that it may feel like the path to promotion for you is more uncertain now.  That’s a pretty tough place to be.  You likely remember my first conversation with you where you felt like you weren’t meeting the requirements to move forward with your plans for promotion.  The good news is that you navigated that uncertainty, secured some upgrades in other roles that were part of your plan, and ultimately did move up.  I trust that you will also move forward with plans for promotion now that you have some additional time to get more senior and prove your value. I want you to know that I continue to believe in your ability and think you are well positioned for future promotion.  Your integrity, your understanding of the business, your soft skills, and the relationships you develop will all be helpful in those conversations and helping you prove your value.I hope you have some opportunities this year to have some more concrete conversations about how you are meeting the requirements and to have other folks, such as Leslie, get a chance to see you deliver.Good luck this year!",2,0.0748999491333962

I've been thinking about what happened and I think I can offer you a bit of encouragement. I know we had discussed how you were feeling a little under prepared for the promotion given that it was new for you and you had not been involved in that work that long. But, I've also been thinking about why it was new to you. And that is due to you and this team delivering really good results. The work feels great. People feel great and know they are in good hands. I think that momentum is very important when making changes and so I thought I'd share something that I've experienced in my own career to try to provide some of that emotional support.When I was promoted to manage the company store, one of the things I noticed early on was that I wasn’t prepared to manage it, because I had never managed it before. So I went back to my manager and I shared that I needed some help and mentoring to manage the store. I told her that I didn’t feel good managing it. And I had a couple of valid reasons for it.

It’s hard to know people in a new city, but I do have a couple of thoughts on how to make her feel more comfortable and meet other people. She can reach out to any friends from college that she has here, and maybe even reach out to the other sister that has also moved here and connect with them, as they’ve moved here too and can maybe help out in some ways. There are also some great meetups that she can consider looking at like Speed Yoga, a tennis group, or taking a class in order to meet new people. I’m sure that she’ll get comfortable soon. She’s getting used to this now, and I hope she feels less lonely and that she starts to feel more connected and less like she is on her own as she tries to adjust.

I’m sure the adjustment to their new city has been difficult but it is important they seek out supports so they can feel confident and have the support they need in these difficult times. I think the best place to start is with the local emergency support line. This can be an amazing resource to connect to people in your area going through a similar experience and also provide information on community resources or programs that may help. They can provide info on activities happening in the area so they can connect with others in their new city. If that is too overwhelming or they just need to talk, I would recommend a coffee and just having someone to listen to them. If they need some concrete suggestions on how they can start this process, I would recommend getting them to join some social groups they’ve been wanting to do this for and committing to joining in next week.

I am so sorry you are going through this.  I know anxiety can feel like it is pulling you under.  You are not alone.  It sounds like you have tried some things already like: increased exercise,  calming music, therapy appointments and prescription medication.  I would suggest checking with your doctor to make sure the prescription medication is something you can manage without talking to your therapist.  If you don’t want to self-prescribe, there are online resources to support self-prescribing.  If these don’t help,  I can suggest ways you can cope.  Trying to slow things down, try to take some deep breaths or breaths while distracted.  I’ve noticed that when I am anxious my breathing becomes short and shallow, and I can distract myself there.  I’ve found if I remind myself to take a couple deep breaths it gets me through the anxiety.  I also find breathing in through the nose and out through my mouth.

But I have learned that in order to manage it, I need to learn how to care for my emotional and physical self. The anxiety doesn’t care, nor does it respect boundaries. It’s been so powerful for me to put this anxiety to use. It’s pushed me to take risks, disrupting the “normal” rhythms of life.

Here are a couple of ideas I’ve had. When I am feeling overwhelmed, I often find my phone in order to be more busy to keep focused. For example, I will watch YouTube videos or play a game. This helps pass the time to feel productive. Another option is to say ‘yes’ to something I haven’t felt ready for or haven’t been productive to try. For example, say yes to a big project even if I feel like I am not prepared. Sometimes I need the help to jump start things to make space for some things too.

I’m so sorry to hear that your relative is feeling anxious about attending a social event! One effective method to manage anxiety is to take a deep breath, relax, and focus on what is happening “now”. I’m curious - are you feeling anxious about their anticipation of how you will react when you see them or just their own social anxiety? If it’s their anticipation, then helping them focus on what’s happening now may help them to think about how great they are and what a good friend and role model they are. If it’s their own social anxiety, you can remind them that you are there to support and validate their feelings. The goal is to help them focus on what is happening now and acknowledge their emotions without escalating them into full-on panic attacks. I hope that helps - please let me know if you’d like to discuss anything else. - AmyHi Amy, They are anxious about my reaction.

I suspect that our neighbor often overhears you being negative in the way that you describe your neighbor and is taking it personally.

My suggestion would be to acknowledge that this is a conflict for you and try to get to the heart of the issue. What does it mean to you?

How I feel depends on the details, but from what I understand, you have a neighbor that has a conflict with you that you have been attempting to address with the neighbor.  If I have understood the situation correctly, it has been difficult to communicate effectively between both neighbors and you have little confidence in your ability to resolve the conflict with the neighbor.   What I suggest is that you set a time with your neighbor when you can discuss both the conflict and your request for more confidence and availability.  It could be a 2-way meeting with an open forum format.  You will need to spend time away from your neighbor to prepare.  Often conflict can be tied to emotion and there is value in building empathy for your neighbor’s perspective.  You could bring a friend to support in the meeting to help you process the discussion.  I suggest that you take control of the process and set clear expectations that you will listen, but you will make decisions.

As far as concrete steps I can take to help with change, I am leaning towards getting a better grasp on mental health topics that have been of great concern to me.  Reading about and exploring new modalities, like meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). I think CBT could help me a lot in figuring out how to manage my thinking and get myself back on track for having more positive outlooks on things.

There is never a reason to worry or feel shameful about your body. Being healthy and taking care of yourself is a top priority for me. I have a couple of thoughts that might help. First, it is ok to not have the same exact goals. You are not expected to attain them all. Instead, focus on being healthy and feeling good. I don't need to be 6 feet tall or weigh 150lbs to feel good. I want to take care of my body and move and eat how I feel good. My height, weight, and body types have no bearing on my self-worth. Second, focus on things you can control. I've been struggling with healthy eating and exercise too and I feel like I'm not losing weight fast enough. The reason I haven't been exercising or eating right is because I'm also struggling with staying home and feeling like I'm not accomplishing anything in my job search.

Offer support, reassurance, and remind them that the journey is more important than the outcome.","One of the great things about sports is that it's a team sport. What matters is not just individual performances, but also how teams function together to reach a common goal. One player failing does not jeopardize the entire team's chances. Everyone in the team is responsible for their own contribution. Even if one player doesn't perform as well as they want, there may be other teammates who did their part to help their team achieve its goal. That's what is so great about sports, that it's a supportive environment for children to face their fears in an accepting community.I think your child is feeling nervous about their performance tomorrow. What I would do is to model acceptance of their fear. I can acknowledge that I'm nervous too. When I perform in public, I'm often nervous or anxious. So much of performing is about trying to manage those feelings and let them go. One of the most important parts of sports is to remember that the process is more important than the results.

Any student can access confidential, anonymous, and supportive peer counseling through SWC. SWC also offers  on-campus workshops and group activities, which can help you find a community where you can connect with others.

Many years ago, I went through a long period of isolation.  It began with my wife’s unexpected departure from our home.  Rather than acknowledging the shock and sadness, I threw myself into a project that helped shape my career.  I was so focused on my personal development, that I intentionally ignored the emotional turmoil of my family.  I ultimately overlooked all of the red flags and remained in my self-inflicted isolation.  Unfortunately, it ended with my wife dying of cancer.  In the aftermath, I felt I failed our family.  It was a challenging time to seek support and solace.  It wasn’t until I started to meet with a counselor that I was able to acknowledge the problems in our life.  Towards the end, I remember a saying a counselor shared, “What is the icing on your cake?”  It was a subtle way to suggest that there is more to my life.

Try and think of a topic that is interesting to you as you anticipate being able to engage in conversation with the other person. I also think it’s important to ask open ended questions that allow people to share their thoughts and ideas. You could for example ask: - How have you seen business change since you were in another industry? - What other industry leaders or colleagues have you found inspiring?- What do you think the main challenge for your industry will be in the future? All this can be a way to get more comfortable with social situations and really get into the conversation. I can imagine the anxiousness will start to drop as you become more engaged.

If you still have their work material, consider asking colleagues what your loved one was interested in, and read some of their work or try to speak to them about a topic they were interested in.

I know it can be scary to be a little bit different.  It’s ok to not be the most popular kid in the school if that is where your heart is.  It might be a little bit of anxiety you feeling but it’s ok.  It’s ok to be a little different and to take a little longer than others to get things.  It’s ok to take your time with things.  If you do that and focus on who you are you will be ok.  I remember feeling like that with social situations and I didn’t know if I would be ok without the validation from others to feel like I was good enough.  I was finally comfortable in my own skin and that made all the difference in my confidence and inner peace.

I would say to you - don't worry about fitting in - and I think that is an important message to share with your child. In fact, your child can learn that by standing out and being a bit different, they can gain the respect of their peers - and that can be a good thing. So my suggestion to you would be to encourage your child to focus on their own strengths and qualities - and build those strengths into their identity. It could be their sense of humour or their leadership qualities or their compassion. Another good point to consider is that there are so many different ways for your child to be different - and that they have a great opportunity to choose how they want to be different. So my suggestion to you is focus on their strengths and qualities - and enable them to focus on the person they want to be.

You can start planning months in advance, and once you start, you will have a sense of how to make time to do the work. You'll also have a clear picture of priorities and goals that will help you stay focused. If you find it hard to keep a tight deadline, there are some things you can try. First, you can push back your due date and plan to get it done earlier. If you work in multiple mediums you can create separate documents for each one. I'm not sure if there is a way to keep all of them updated, but  it may help you to have all of them in a place where you can dive into them in one shot when you need to. If you really need to, you can tell your team you will do your best but that you cannot be held accountable to the original deadline if you need more time.

As hard as it is to let go of decisions, I believe it’s also necessary to not worry so much about making the best decision. When I get caught up in stressing over my past decisions, I also sometimes tend to avoid new possibilities that could arise.So, I feel it’s important to take some time and evaluate the decision from an outside perspective. I want to not worry so much about whether I made the best decision; instead I’m curious about how I’m doing now, and if I’m experiencing",2,0.226341068744659

In my past I had a deep fear to move forward, but it was a learning process that taught me to be more bold and independent. If I was to go back and not let go of that situation, I would be afraid of challenges and not take the risk. Now, my regret is useless. I realize that I did not try to seize the opportunity to learn and grow and so I better take the chance now to let it go. There are always chances and I hope I seize them to improve my life.

I hope your friend is able to get some support (individual, but also getting together with other parents in general - especially given how sleep-deprived we all are right now). I’m also happy to pass along some words of understanding and practical tips on how to take care of ourselves. I see parenting as a constant readjusting of how I want to set things up - I’ve needed to allow for both individual needs as well as flexibility to change routines when things feel icky and out of sorts. And to adjust to the needs of the individual. I’ve also needed to try out things - and throw the ones I don’t like or don’t work out. I’ve realised what it is I want - and I’ve adjusted my home to reflect that - and made the daily grind happen in my home.

If you notice an incident start to happen at school, immediately intervene - do not wait for a teacher to break it up 3. Create a “No Bullying” charter and promote it to the rest of the student body. I would suggest a simple but effective declaration stating that - I will not allow any form of bullying to occur in our school, and I hope all students take part in this charter 4. Create a list of consistent, helpful people to reach out to for both social support and advice. There are many social workers, counselors, and staff throughout the school who could be of assistance. With that said, It is critically important to reinforce the notion that they need to communicate their discomfort and concerns.

Try making a schedule for yourself to refocus and take a step back from social media.

I've heard the saying ""The customer is always right"" and I try to remind myself of that. As hard as it is to hear the feedback from your coworker, it is probably true that their experience is different from how I perceive it. I've been in situations like this, where the client has pressured the team to do things out of scope.

This should help your parent feel confident in their schedule and feel less pressure to hit their travel goals if the day is unforeseen delays or cancellations. As for safety, it's also important to prepare by making sure your parent has a safety plan for their location - some pointers to stay safe could be contacting a friend or family member for advice or guidance as well as having a sense of self-defense in case they feel threatened.

If they are driving, they can also take the time to stop at every red light. They can set aside a larger stash of cash than usual. A different idea is to use a rewards app like ripple. Using this app, they can “spot” a cash reward in an amount that is meaningful to them at the end of their trip. They can also set aside a cellphone plan that has enough data for the day.

Creating something completely outside of work that you are excited about will help you feel more passionate about what you’re doing. I had a coworker who made a side hustle out of pranking their boss, and it turned into a competitive spirit between her and I in the office. I would encourage you to take some time to think about what truly makes you happy, and then try to break from what you currently do to make it work.One piece of advice, I think it’s really important",1,0.774411082267761

I can empathize, as I too felt this frustration at one point in my life. I too needed a shift in career. I was feeling like I was in a mundane role, that wasn’t challenging me or allowing me to use my skills and experience to my benefit. I always thought that if I took the step into the unknown, in some ways it would be more safe as I felt like I had experienced all things that had happened to me previously, so it was time to have a different challenge. I wanted to challenge myself and also work with people that I did not know and see if I could thrive in that environment and be successful.I am not sure if you feel challenged or fearful. I will share with you, that I first started on the team and I was not sure if my skillset was appreciated or valued, but as I stayed and delivered to what we needed, I began to understand the manager’s expectations and we had an open conversation.

I empathize with how challenging it is to feel like you’re drowning financially and not know where to start. One great way to get your head around your finances is to set aside time each week to take a close look at the money coming in and out of your bank account. Start by setting up a recurring transfer or auto-pay on your bills and then, week-to-week, start paying more attention to how much money is coming into your account from all sources. Once you’ve identified a few regular income sources (eg: a salary, steady consulting work, or steady freelance work) try plugging those in to a budget. What’s left? That’s your discretionary income, the money you can spend on luxuries and saving for goals. Spend some time this week exploring resources on budgeting and goal-setting. Maybe you’re feeling a bit stressed because you don’t have control over the finances and you’re trying to meet the monthly obligations and left feeling like you’re spinning your wheels and not making progress towards your goals.

When I feel overwhelmed like this, one of my favorite ways to feel less anxious is to take a step back and create a clear plan of action to address my current situation. Budgeting is a good place to start as I feel it helps to see all of my options and keep myself in control. If I don’t know where I am financially or how my expenses are trending I find it difficult to manage my stress levels. If I feel like I am falling behind on expenses or if things are getting out of control, then I like to create a plan to either save more money or pay off debts first. This helps me to clear my head so that I can get some clarity around what my realistic options are.Next, I like to think of everything that is out of my control. This is a good tool to use to help me gain clarity around my perceived pressures in my life. There are a few things that I have been able to change that I am proud of this year like setting up a plan to repay my student loans.

The best way for me to support them at this point is to offer some budgeting strategies and provide some resources that they can use to help monitor their expenses and where they might be able to cut some costs. One of the strategies that they could potentially start with is a financial spreadsheet. This could be done on paper or with a tool like Wesabe. The concept here is that they take a look at their income, outgoings, and savings. The other piece of advice I have for them is to seek advice from a  professional. I know they could benefit from a personal finance consultant or a financial advisor. These could either be someone in their network or could be an external service. I would recommend looking at these options and vetting some referrals as it's worth the cost of having a more proactive financial advisor to help manage their money.",2,2.64886450767517

I know it can be challenging to maintain a positive attitude in the face of pressure. Anxiety can make thinking and reasoning difficult, which can make it hard to focus and sustain concentration.

Identify some tasks that can be done now that won’t be possible when under pressure - such as taking a break to talk with friends, making a plan for studying, or getting ready for upcoming deadlines. 2. Try some relaxation exercises that can help with getting ready for exams. Some examples include deep breathing, visualizations, or muscle relaxation.3. It can be helpful to get some feedback on how you’re doing before an exam. It can help to ask for this feedback directly from others who know you well (e.g. close friends, spouse, family members, or mentors) or to set up a mental time capsule with an impartial person (e.g. supervisor, counselor, or someone outside your normal social circle). This feedback can be used to re-enforce a positive attitude or identify triggers in your environment or lifestyle that could be causing anxiety.",2,1.89043188095093
